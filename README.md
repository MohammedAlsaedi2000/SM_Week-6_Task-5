# Controlling motors' direction using H-Bridge

## Description
Some simple robots have two wheels used for moving around.
In this project I designed or simulated two motors and H-Bridge (Motor Driver) to control the direction of the motors. Controlling the direction is important becuae the robot can move in every direction, for example:
two motors together rotate in the clockwise direction, the resultant moving direction will be FORWARD and vice versa
If one motor rotates Clockwise and the second motor rotates in the Counter Clockwise direction, the resultant moving direction will be either right or left depending on your perspective.
